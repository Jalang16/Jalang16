- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jalang16
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the different languages that contribute to Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the intent to learn Java, CSS and HTML afterwards.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I am incredibly green and was told this would be a good place to develop my skills as well as my portfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
